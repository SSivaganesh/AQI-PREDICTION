## 🧠 About the Project

Air pollution is a major environmental risk to health. The purpose of this project is to build a reliable model that can predict AQI values based on past pollutant data like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 levels. These predictions can help in early warnings and decision-making.
